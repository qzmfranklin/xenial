This directory contains the files that should be copied to the iso image to make
the iso install automatically.

Here is a list of files touched and a brief description of what was changed
according to the original content.  The root path / is the root of the iso.

1.  /isolinux/isolinux.cfg

Commented the following two lines
    ```
    default vesamenu.c32
    ui gfxboot bootlogo
    ```

Without this change, a human has to select the language.


2.  /isolinux/txt.cfg

Largely inspired/taken from the following thread:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/806820/how-do-i-create-a-completely-unattended-install-of-ubuntu-desktop-16-04-1-lts

Though, the above thread talked about the desktop version.

Note that I also added the following after the triple dash:
    console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200

According to the Linux kernel Documentation/serialconsole.txt, the output is
directed to the serial port (ttyS0) instead of vga (tty0).


3.  preseed/geek.seed

Modified from the official example preseed file, as downloadable here:
        https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/example-preseed.txt

Modified the following fields:
    d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US
    d-i passwd/user-fullname string GeekMe
    d-i passwd/username string geek
    d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password dhw55L1G6Og9Y
    d-i user-setup/allow-password-weak boolean true
